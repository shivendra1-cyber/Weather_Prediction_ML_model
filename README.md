## Introduction

In this project, you'll learn how to predict your local weather by following these steps:

1. Downloading the weather data.
2. Preparing the data for machine learning.
3. Building and evaluating a ridge regression model.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivendra1-cyber/weather-prediction-ml.git
cd weather-prediction-ml
Next, you'll need to install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage these dependencies. You can create one and install the dependencies by running:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Before building the model, you'll need to download the weather data. You can find various weather datasets online, such as from NOAA or Kaggle. Once you have the data, place it in the data/ directory.

In the Jupyter Notebook, you'll perform the following steps:

Load the data using Pandas.
Clean and preprocess the data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building
With the prepared data, you'll build a ridge regression model using Scikit-Learn. In the Jupyter Notebook, you'll follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries from Scikit-Learn.
Train the ridge regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
Usage
To run the tutorial, open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Navigate to the weather_prediction.ipynb file and follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the tutorial.
